I am researching deep learning algorithms on 3D point clouds, supervised by Prof. Fuxin Li.</p><br/><p>Previously, I was a Computer Vision Scientist at Clobotics Global, researching numerous feasible deep learning algorithms for image classification and object detection to improve the product recognition cloud engine for retail insights as a service (RIAAS). Besides implementing state-of-art algorithms and optimizing its performance for the end-to-end AI product, I was a Machine Learning Engineer working on many AI infrastructure development, such as ceiling analysis dashboards, active learning pipeline, image retrieval system, distributed data pipeline, product search website, and data operations platform.</p><br/><p>Weikun Han received an M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UCLA, supervised by Prof. Lei He. He received a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University, supervised by Prof. Liang Dong. He also received the IEEE NANO best student paper award, and he co-authored five publications in major journals and conferences during the undergraduate research study. </p><br/><span class='p logo blue bold h3'>Interests</span><br/><br/><span class='btn solid large'><a class="button" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision' title='Computer Vision'><i class='fas fa-smile'></i>Computer Vision</a></span><span class='btn solid large'><a class="button" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning' title='Deep Learning'><i class='fas fa-grin-beam'></i>Deep Learning</a></span> <span class='btn solid large'><a class="button" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning' title='Machine Learning'><i class='fas fa-grin-wink'></i>Machine Learning</a></span> <br/><br/><span class='p logo blue bold h3'>Education</span><div class="timeline"><div class="timenode"><div class="meta"><p><p>2018</p></p></div><div class="body"><p>M.S., Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California Los Angeles</p></div></div><div class="timenode"><div class="meta"><p><p>2016</p></p></div><div class="body"><p>B.S., Electrical Engineering, Iowa State University, </p></div></div></div>]]></content>
